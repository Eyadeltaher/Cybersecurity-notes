# CTFs & Write-Ups

This directory contains **CTF notes, challenge write-ups, and practical exploitation techniques** collected during learning and hands-on practice.

The content here is a mix of:
- **Notes taken from reading high-quality CTF write-ups**
- **Personal notes from CTF challenges I personally solved**
- Practical payloads and proof-of-concept files used during challenges

---

## How This Directory Is Used

- I read well-written and educational CTF write-ups and **summarize the important ideas, techniques, and tricks** in my own words.
- For **good and educational CTFs that I personally solve**, I write down:
  - The vulnerability
  - The exploitation flow
  - Key takeaways and lessons learned
- Useful payloads and test files are kept for future reference.

## Goal
